 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Quadrature Encoder Interface.
 *
 * A quadrature encoder consists of two code tracks on a disc which are 90
 * degrees out of phase. It can be used to determine how far a wheel has
 * rotated, relative to a known starting position.
 *
 * Only one code track changes at a time leading to a more robust system than
 * a single track, because any jitter around any edge won't cause a state
 * change as the other track will remain constant.
 *
 * Encoders can be a homebrew affair, consisting of infrared emitters/receivers
 * and paper code tracks consisting of alternating black and white sections;
 * alternatively, complete disk and PCB emitter/receiver encoder systems can
 * be bought, but the interface, regardless of implementation is the same.

 * The interface uses X2 encoding by default which calculates the pulse count
 * based on reading the current state after each rising and falling edge of
 * channel A.

 *
 * This interface can also use X4 encoding which calculates the pulse count
 * based on reading the current state after each rising and falling edge of
 * either channel.

 * An optional index channel can be used which determines when a full
 * revolution has occured.
 *
 * If a 4 pules per revolution encoder was used, with X4 encoding,
 * the following would be observed.

 *
 * Rotational position in degrees can be calculated by:
 *
 * (pulse count / X * N) * 360
 *
 * Where X is the encoding type [e.g. X4 encoding => X=4], and N is the number
 * of pulses per revolution.
 *
 * Linear position can be calculated by:
 *
 * (pulse count / X * N) * (1 / PPI)
 *
 * Where X is encoding type [e.g. X4 encoding => X=44], N is the number of
 * pulses per revolution, and PPI is pulses per inch, or the equivalent for
 * any other unit of displacement. PPI can be calculated by taking the
 * circumference of the wheel or encoder disk and dividing it by the number
 * of pulses per revolution.
